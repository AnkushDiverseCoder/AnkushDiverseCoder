### Hi, I'm Ankush Thakur

I'm a full stack web developer on an exciting journey through the world of technology while pursuing my B-Tech degree at Ellenki Degree College of Engineering. Education-wise, I rocked a stellar 9.9 CGPA in my intermediate days at Nalanda College, and in 10th grade at Gowtham Model School, I bagged a cool 9.8 CGPA.

I'm your go-to person for Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, and I love crafting awesome web experiences with Node.js, React, and MongoDB. Linux? Yep, I'm pretty comfy with that too. But wait, there's moreâ€”I'm not just stopping at Web 2.0; I'm diving headfirst into the intriguing world of Web 3.0.

When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me glued to thrilling web series or sipping on some coffeeâ€”seriously, I'm a coffee enthusiast! But that's not all; I'm also a fan of outdoor adventures. Skateboarding and hiking are my go-to activities when I'm not plugged into the digital world.

Let's connect and chat about tech, life, or anything under the sun. I'm all about continuous learning and making the most out of every experience. Cheers to the journey ahead! ðŸŒŸ
